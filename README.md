## Features  
- **Data Exploration**: Insights into the distribution of spam and ham messages.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Tokenization and word frequency analysis to build a robust word-based filter.  
- **Naive Bayes Implementation**: Classification using probability calculations with Laplace smoothing.  
- **Error Analysis**: Examination of misclassified messages to identify areas for improvement.
